_Hey there. I'm David. Nice to meet you._

## Basic Bio
### Residence and Family
I currently reside in Seattle, Washington with my wife, Ashley, our two kids (Ariadne and Charisma) and our dog (Starbuck - from Battlestar Galactica or alternatively, Moby Dick. Not the coffee company). We moved here from the San Francisco Bay Area and I'm unlikely to move anywhere else again. Seattle is my favorite place on Earth.

I was raised in a military family (by occupation, not culture), and lived variously in Missouri, Georgia, Germany (Berlin) and Hawaii before we settled in Colorado Springs when I was 11 years old.

My wife and I moved to California with our kids when I started working with Udacity and finally to Seattle during the Covid-19 pandemic when we realized that we were working from home anyway and had no particular reason to continue doing so _from_ California.

### The Stuff I Care About
I have [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html) (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder). Because the condition did not present with the traditional hyperactivity and behavior problems that are commonly associated with the disorder, I was not properly diagnosed until very recently (2022). 

As a result, I struggled with organization, prioritization and decision making all through adolescence and the early part of adulthood. That struggle has informed much of my life and career, so I present it here to help paint a more complete picture of who I am and how I got here.

#### Education
To say the public education system in the United States failed me is a bit of an understatement. The system is fundamentally broken. I believe it is primarily designed to produce compliant workers, not critical thinkers. Our current education models from K-12 through higher education are a result of attempts to compete in the post-WWII industrial economy. We have not adapted well as a society to the connected, information economy of the 21st century.

Education is the single most important factor in determining the quality of life for an individual and the quality of life for a society. I believe that education is a human right and that it should be free and accessible to everyone. The current education system is a barrier to that right and that it must be reformed or replaced.

#### Mental Health
As a society, we are making good progress at destigmatizing mental health issues. However, we still have a long way to go. I believe that mental health is a key component of overall health and that it should be treated as such. I am a strong advocate for mental health awareness and treatment, access to mental health services and medication and the destigmatization of mental health issues.

#### Video Games
There's really nothing better than video games to massage an ADHD brain. They're a perfect combination of immediate feedback, constant novelty and the ability to hyperfocus on a single task for hours at a time. I've been playing video games since I was 5 years old and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.

Currently, I'm playing a lot of Diablo IV, but I'll play pretty much anything except first person shooters (because I'm very, very bad at them).

#### Code and Software Engineering
I wrote my first line of BASIC when I was eleven years old. If I'd been more successful academically during high school, I almost certainly would have wound up as a software engineer out of college. I've always been fascinated by the ability to create something out of nothing with code. It's a superpower, and I love every minute of writing it.

I primarily write code in Python and TypeScript. I've also dabbled a bit in Go, Rust, and Ruby.

## FAQ
 
#### You've had a lot of jobs. Why?
Short answer: I have ADHD, and I had a hard time staying engaged with a job for more than a year or two. I also had a hard time finding a job that I was good at and that I enjoyed. 

Honestly, though, I think it's a good thing. I've had the opportunity to work in a lot of different industries and roles. I've learned a lot about myself and what I'm good at. I've also learned a lot about what I'm not good at and what I don't enjoy.

#### What's your favorite programming language?
It's always going to be Python. Sorry, Rustaceans.

#### Do you still speak Arabic?
Nope. I haven't spoken Arabic since I left the Army in 2005. I can still read it, though. Unfortunately, I never really had the chance to use it professionally, since the Army sent me to the wrong desert. I still pull it out as my fun fact at professional get-to-know-you events, though.

#### What's your favorite video game?
It changes. In terms of games I've gone back to over and over again, though, I'd have to say Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. It suffered from a lot of balance issues (as did most of the early Civ games), but SMAC is a masterclass in world building and storytelling.

#### Why did you become a Product Manager?
The world may never know. Product management is a bit of an odd duck, because no one really knows what it is, exactly. But I love building things, solving problems and working with people. Product management is a great way to do all three of those things.

#### What's your favorite book?
The next one. Put to the test though, I have a few:
* Life of Pi
* The Kite Runner
* The Time Traveler's Wife
* 1984
* Everything Douglas Adams ever wrote

#### What are your thoughts on Robert Frost's famous poem, "The Road Not Taken"?
Okay. You didn't ask this, but I'm going to tell you anyway.

"The Road Not Taken" has the incredible honor of being the most _misinterpreted_ poem in the history of English language poetry. The last phrase of the poem, "I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference" is often interpreted as a celebration of individualism and non-conformity, but the real meaning of the poem is right there in the title: "The Road _Not_ Taken"

The poem is about regret, or rather, _fending off_ regret. It's about the choices we make in life and how we can never know what would have happened if we'd made a different choice. In the end, the narrator attempts to convince themselves (and those around them) that they made the right choice, even though they'll never know for sure.

This is my number one soapbox topic. I apologize in advance if it ever comes up in conversation. It's not all that important in the grand scheme of things, but I just can't help myself.
